# Pokemon Sample Application

Pokestarter is a sample application created to use in the **Creating a Continuous Integration/Deployment System** workshop for the
**Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing 2016**. This application returns a random starter Pokemon
as a web page and as an API call.

## Aditional GitHub Integration Setup
#### Pull Request Status Updates
1. GitHub, go to *Settings -> Personal access tokens*
2. Click **Generate new token**
3. Give the token a description and click the checkbox for **repo:status**
4. Click **Generate token** and copy the created token
5. In Jenkins, go to  **Manage Jenkins -> Configure System**
6. Scroll down to **GitHub Pull Request Builder**
7. Click the **Add** button by **Credentials**

#### Pull Request Webhook with Local Jenkins
1. Run ngrok to connect your local Jenkins to the internet using `./ngrok http <jenkins-ip>:8080`
2. Navigate to your forked repository on GitHub and go to **Settings -> Webhooks**
3. Copy your ngrok URL into the Payload URL  and add **/ghprbhook/** to the end. There *MUST* be a / at the end of the URL, otherwise you will get a 403 error.
4. Select **Let me select individual events** and check **Pull request**, **Pull request review comment**, and **Issue comment**.
5. For pull request jobs, under **Build Triggers**, check **Use github hooks for build triggering**.


#### Push Webhook with Local Jenkins
1. Create a second webhook with **/github-webhook/** at the end. Again, there *MUST* be a / at the end.
2. Select **Just the push event**
3. For the Trigger Pipeline job, check **Build when a change is pushed to GitHub**.
